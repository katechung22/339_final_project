                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>"Based on Dota Auto Chess, a mod for Dota 2, the game centers around eight players who construct teams to fight one another and be the last player standing. The battlefield consists of hexagons, where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for that round, or else paired against computer-controlled enemies, frequently called PVE rounds. In the rounds against computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, or items that the player can use. Health lost from losing a round is calculated with a combination of set damage per round and how many units an opponent had still alive." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

                <h2>Why I Enjoy <i>Teamfight Tactics</i></h2>
                <p><i>Teamfight Tactics</i> was my gateway into Riot Games's ecosystem. I have always been a fan of team/deck-building games, so when this game released, I was pleasantly surprised at its gameplay, but more so, its incredible animations. I think one of the best aspects of this game is the fact that you are able to watch your team fight in real-time against other teams. This game is very dynamic and progresses where you can actively make your team stronger and stronger. I still enjoy regularly playing <i>Teamfight Tactics</i> and love to meet people who also have a similar passion!</p>
