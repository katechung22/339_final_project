                <h2>Character Description</h2>
                <p>"Moira O'Deorain is a character from the 2016 video game Overwatch, a Blizzard Entertainmentâ€“developed first-person shooter. First appearing in a 2017 tie-in comic, she was later added as a playable character in an update for game, and later returned for its sequel. Moira serves as a healer who can refill her resources by damaging enemies with her main attack. Within the Overwatch story, she is an Irish geneticist who refuses to let any ethical constraints interfere with scientific advancement, and works with the terrorist group Talon to this end while posing as a member of the scientific community. Since the game's release she has appeared in various spinoff media related to the franchise, including comics and merchandise." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>
