                <ul>
                    <li>Novaburst: Deals Quantum DMG equal to 25% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.</li>
                    <li>Known by Stars, Shown by Hearts: Activates Matrix of Prescience. Other team members will Apportion 65% of the DMG they receive (before this DMG is mitigated by any Shields) to Fu Xuan for 3 turn(s). All team members are affected by Matrix of Prescience and gain the Knowledge effect, which increases their respective Max HP by 3% of Fu Xuan's Max HP, and increases CRIT Rate by 6%. When Fu Xuan is knocked down, the Matrix of Prescience will be dispelled.</li>
                    <li>Woes of Many Morphed to One: Deals Quantum DMG equal to 60% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to all enemies and obtains 1 trigger count for the HP Restore from Fu Xuan's Talent.
                        (The restoration triggered by Fu Xuanâ€™s Talent can exist up to a maximum of 2 times, but there is no upper limit on the number of times the ultimate obtains 1 trigger count.)</li>
                    <li>Bleak Breeds Bliss: While Fu Xuan has not been knocked down, Misfortune Avoidance is applied to the entire team. While affected by Misfortune Avoidance, allies take 10% less DMG. HP Restore will be triggered for Fu Xuan when her HP falls to 50% or less of her Max HP. This effect will restore her HP by 80% of the amount of HP she is currently missing. This effect cannot be triggered if she receives a killing blow. This effect possesses 1 triggered count by default, and can possess up to 2 trigger counts maximum.</li>
