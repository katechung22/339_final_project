                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>"League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>"League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective. As of 2023, there are over 160 champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies. Items can be acquired to increase champions' strength, and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

                <h2>Why I Enjoy <i>League of Legends</i></h2>
                <p>I started playing League a little bit before quarantining, in October 2020. I made new friends from school while playing together, and League soon become the main way in which I would stay connected with those friends while not being able to see them. I think something that makes this game so enjoyable, 4 years later, is the replayability of this game and the fact that there are so many characters, or champions, that you can play.</p>
