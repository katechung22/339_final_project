                <h2>Character Description</h2>
                <p>"Kirby is the titular character and protagonist of the Kirby series of video games owned by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory. He first appeared in Kirby's Dream Land (1992), a platform game for the Game Boy. Since then, Kirby has appeared in over 50 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball, and has been featured as a playable character in every installment of the Super Smash Bros. He has also starred in his own anime and manga series. Kirby's signature skill is his ability to inhale objects or creatures and spit them out as projectiles, as well as the ability to suck in air to float over obstacles. His Copy Ability grants him the power to adopt the abilities of the creatures he inhales, while also wearing various costumes or transforming his shape. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, such as his homeworld Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare. On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and Meta Knight. In virtually all of his appearances, Kirby is depicted as a cheerful, innocent and food-loving character."

                    <li>Copy Ability: Kirby gets his abilities are from inhaling then swallowing certain enemies, mid-bosses, weapons or objects. However, an ability won't necessarily have all the attacks that an enemy can perform. Kirby can also do moves that the enemy cannot. However, some enemies are ability-neutral, meaning they do not yield powers.</li>
