                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>"Honkai: Star Rail follows the gameplay style of classic Japanese role-playing games: players build up a lineup of characters and control a team of up to four in turn-based combat. In addition to various stats that affect characters' strength, each character has an elemental type that affects the kind of damage dealt to targets, a character class referred to as a Path (see Story and Setting ยง Setting) that defines their combat role, and a set of unique abilities called Traces used in combat. Each character can equip a weapon known as a Light Cone, that has various effects that activate if the Paths of both the character and Light Cone match. Characters can also equip various Relics, similar to Artifacts in Genshin Impact. Elements of open-world and dungeon exploration are present, with multiple mechanics, including the gacha system, carried over (with slight differences) from miHoYo's previous action RPG Genshin Impact. Both games are gacha games, in which players spend in-game currency that can be earned in-game or purchased with real money to receive new characters and weapons." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

                <h2>Why I Enjoy <i>Honkai: Star Rail</i></h2>
                <p>I started plating <i>Honkai: Star Rail</i> right when it first came out in April, 2023. At first, I was really drawn to the great graphics and cool character designs. I also love playing gatcha games and potentially pulling for strong characters in the game. My enjoyment for this game has grown over time, as new additions to the world and new characters have continually immersed me in the <i>Honkai</i> universe. I appreciate the beautful gameplay effects as well as the straight-forward mechanics in this game.</p>
