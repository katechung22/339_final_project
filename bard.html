                <h2>Character Description</h2>
                <p>"A traveler from beyond the stars, Bard is an agent of serendipity who fights to maintain a balance where life can endure the indifference of chaos. Many Runeterrans sing songs that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful spirit meeps, it is impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the greater good... in his own odd way."

                <ul>
                    <li>Cosmic Binding: Bard fires a missile which will slow the first enemy struck, and continue onward. If it strikes a wall, it will stun the initial target; if it strikes another enemy, it will stun them both.</li>
                    <li>Caretaker's Shrine: Reveals a Health shrine which powers up over a short time, disappearing after healing and speeding up the first ally that touches it.</li>
                    <li>Magical Journey: Bard opens a portal in nearby terrain. Allies and enemies alike can take a one-way trip through that terrain by moving into the portal.</li>
                    <li>Tempered Fate: Bard sends spirit energy arcing to a location, putting all champions, minions, monsters, and turrets hit into stasis for a brief time.</li>
