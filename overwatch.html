                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>"Overwatch 2 is a 2022 first-person shooter game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. As a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S and features full cross-platform play. The game was released in early access on 4 October 2022. Blizzard dropped the early access label for the game on August 10, 2023 with the release of Overwatch 2's sixth season."

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>"Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a "hero" from a roster of 39 characters. Characters are organized into a "damage" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a "support" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a "tank" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches. The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team. In Overwatch 2, the number of tank slots was reduced by one, bringing the total number of players per team to five. According to game director Aaron Keller, developers hoped that losing a tank would speed up gameplay as they believed that the original six players scheme rendered gameplay slow. It is also intended to ease the amount of things players and spectators need to watch out for. New maps were designed to include more cover options to compensate for reduced tank-based protection. Additionally, damage class heroes now have an increased movement speed, support heroes slowly regenerate, and tank heroes were redesigned so they could take on a more offensive role. Heroes were visually refurbished as to reflect the passage of time since the events of the first game. Overwatch 2 includes a ping system to direct the attention of teammates to specific points on the map." Source: <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

                <h2>Why I Enjoy <i>Overwatch</i></h2>
                <p>I play <i>Overwatch</i> on and off, but whenever I do play, it is always an enjoyable experience. I think that the chatacters' abilities are really diverse and exhilerating to use, and the flashing animations and colorful characters make this first-person shooting game very interesting to play.</p>
